# SCONES : Self-Consistent Neural Network for Protein Stability Prediction Upon Mutation

SCONES is a robust interpretable minimalistic structure-based method for estimating relative protein stabilities for missense mutations.

The repository is organized into four sections:
- DataGeneration: tools to create and build datasets
- Analysis: tools to analyze predictions and datasets
- DataCollection: tools to retrive predictions from existing methods
- SCONES: code for training SCONES

Each section is independent and contains separate installation and usage instructions.
